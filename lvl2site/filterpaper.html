	<b>What is a digital filter? </b><br>
	<p>
	A digital filter is very much what it says on the tin. It filters out
	the high, or low, frequencies in a filtered signal, allowing us to
	remove unwanted noise. Or in a less scientific field, to reduce
	mic feedback in sound systems (by cutting out unwanted frequencies, again).
	</p>
	<p>
		An analogue filter is a relatively simple circuit that
		containing a capacitor, and a resistor (or some load)
		(<a href="figs/fig2.html"> Fig. 2 </a>). Because the voltage through the capacitor is
		frequency dependent (See <a href="appendix.html">Appendix 1</a>) we can see that by
		changing the capacitance, we can effect what frequencies are
		filtered out. We want to create a digital system that
		carries out the same job as an analogue filter. To do this
		we carry out a bilinear transform on the transfer function
		(see <a href="appendix.html">Appendix 2</a>), and build a process to carry out the
		sample shift operation that this transform gives us.
		It was decided that our digital filter would be made up of an
		analogue-to-digital convert (ADC), to convert the incoming analogue signal to one that the processor can
		deal with & a processor, or in our case, an FPGA, to carry out our signal processing/filtering; the filtering
		block itself, containing all our signal processing; and a DAC block, to convert the data back to analogue
		(or at least to send serial data to the DAC card).

	<p>
		There are 2 categories of digital filters: FIR & IIR, finite impulse response, and infinite impulse response.
		In our case we are using an IIR, a signal process that is recursive, taking the output of one process, and
		using it again to create a final output that is an infinite sum of all the previous values.

	<b>Why Digital filtering?</b>
	<p>
		The classic form of filter is the analogue filter, a fairly simple device that filters either high, or low frequencies out of an incoming signal (<a href="figs/fig2.html">Fig. 2</a>). 
		Digital filters have many advantages over these basic circuit devices however, making them preferable in many modern applications.
		In modern physics, we may require that the output of a filter is used to control another part of a system. In an analogue filter, attaching another output connection will 
		likely negatively effect the quality of the output.

	</div>
	<p>
		Given that analogue filters are hard wired circuits, it is difficult to reconfigure them, requiring resoldering new components in place of those already installed, whereas a digital filter merely requires a change in variables. Electrical components also tend to have a limited accuracy (usually +/- 5%), and degrade over time (eventually requiring replacement), which, when we require very precise measurements, is not ideal.
		Another issue that we have to consider is the cost. The capacitor required to give filter coefficients of the order we are working with can cost (especially if they need replacing regularly due to degradation), and are not massively reliable (and as before have limited accuracy, and degrade). The potentially large size of these capacitors may also be of note. Along with the cost of replacing other defective components as issues arise, an analogue filter to perform the same job as our digital filter could have significant building and upkeep costs.

	<b>A Digital Passthrough</b>
	<div class="rightimg">
		<img src="figs/fig3.png" alt="Fig. 3: Block diagram for 'straight through' filter" width="400">
	</div> 
	<p>To start building our filter, we first wanted a clean slate, of sorts. A setup that we could simply insert out filter diagram into, and have it work. So we began by building a simple ‘straight through’ digital filter, 
		that would carry out no signal processing, simply convert the incoming 
		analogue signal to digital using an ADC block then feed into another block containing our DAC, converting it back from digital to an analogue
		output (<a href="figs/fig3.html">Fig. 3</a>). In the case of the ADC, we can use a built in block from Vivado. We take the 16 bit output of this and take the most significant 12 bits (because our DAC card can only take 12 bits of data, 
		requiring some config info to be given to it too), and append ‘0000’ to the start of it 
		<div class="leftimg">
			 <img src="figs/fig4.png" alt="Fig. 4: Here we append '0000' to the beginning of our data output">
		</div>
		This is then built into an IP block, so that we can easily manipulate what is between our two converters. <div class="rightimg"><img src="figs/fig5.png" width="300"></div>
		A DAC block is also required, to reconvert our output, however there is no inbuilt on fit for our purpose, so we had to build our own. Our DAC card takes a serial input, so we had to put together a (less than
	 	beautiful) series of clocks and counters in order for our data output to be fed to the card in the correct form. 
	</p>

	</div>
	<b>The Code:</b>
	<P>
	Here we have 2 separate clocks. 1  	2 bit ticking up every clock cycle, the other 	ticking every 16 ticks of the previous clock 	(with a hard reset as it won't overflow to 0 at 	17). 
	The data (in this case from the switches, but 	this can be from any 16 bit input) is taken into a 	register on the 16th cycle of the slower clock. 	The most significant bit is sent to the DAC for 	
	each of the slow clock cycles (as this is 	approximately at the rate the DAC will take 	data), with the data then being shifted left 1 bit 	(so that the next bit can be sent). We also have 	
	to send a 'SYNC' signal to the DAC so that it knows where each set of data starts and ends.

	<p>
		
		With our passthrough built, we next needed to
		make sure we could manipulate our signal
		data and still get a good output, so we
		attempted to build a simple signal processor to
		increase and decrease the amplitude of the
		signal on a terminal command. Carrying out
		this signal manipulation is not as simple as
		merely multiplying the signal data from our
		ADC by our gain value, as VHDL cannot
		handle floating point arithmetic (and doesn’t
		view numbers in a decimal form), instead, we
		have to work with fixed point binary. VHDL will happily take a decimal number, but will store it in
		binary form, so we needed to assign the variables holding these values so that they were long
		enough to hold these numbers, and we needed to decide where our decimal point was (we
		chose 8 bits in), as our processor doesn’t know, or care, about our arbitrary point. Obviously this
		isn’t complicated with our incoming variables (the gain and ADC output), but when we multiply
		them together, the result becomes longer, and our arbitrary point will move (<a href="appendix.html">Appendix 3</a>). To
		combat this we created new, sign extended, variables that were the same length as our
		expected result (32 bits), that way when we multiplied the maximum values each can take all
		the sign bits would fall off the end and we get the maximum possible signed 32 bit integer,
		conveniently this is also the length that C expects to store integers as. Next we needed to crop
		the 32 bit product down so that our DAC can convert the data back. Baring in mind that our
		decimal points were each 8 bits in, we know the product’s point is 16 bits in, so we took the 12
		bits above that (This will cause some issues if the product is higher than the 12 bits can hold)
		and feed them out to the DAC block.
		To begin with, just to ensure our program works correctly, we set our gain input to be inputted via the
		switches on our BASYS 3, directly inputting their value into our new signal processing block, assigning
		the decimal point between the 8th and 9th switches (to fit with the code we’ve written). (<a href="figs/fig5.html">Fig. 5</a>)
		Once this was working, we moved onto the more complex task of having the gain be input via terminal.
		This required the use of a MicroBlaze soft core, in order to make use of shared memory so that our
		terminal can communicate with the FPGA, to transmit our gain input and receive any feedback
		messages. This made the whole block diagram much more complicated (<a href="figs/fig9.html">Fig. 9</a>)
		<div class="rightimg">
			<img src="figs/fig9.png" width="700">
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
	Basically, we have the same set of blocks along the bottom of the diagram as our switch controlled gain, but now our gain is inputted from the output of 
	the memory from the MicroBlaze, instead of our switches. Once we had our MicroBlaze, we could write some C code to control the gain and memory:
	</p>
	<div class="leftimg">
		<img src="figs/fig10.png" width="200">
	</div>	
	<b>The Code:</b>
	<p>
		XPAR_BRAM_0_BASEADDR is the 	memory address for the shared memory between the 	computer and our FPGA, this is where our gain value is 	stored, and
		 accessed by the filter block. We set a 	sensible upper limit on the length of the terminal input, 	200 characters, and store the input in 	
		 'XPAR_UARTLITE_0_BASEADDR' character by 	character as they are typed. If the input is '\r' (return) 	we then take the stored string and check if it contains 	
		 the word 'gain'. If it does we find the characters 	immediately after the '=' following it and take them as 	our gain, multiplied by 'ONEPOS', the value of the 
		 	position of our 1 value (i.e. adding 8 decimal places, 	0x00001000 = 8). We then print back the value of the 	gain we just set to the terminal, reset our character 						counter to 0, and wait for a new input.
		This is as far as we got in our project, so the next section is purely a 'what we would do'/theory section.
	</p>

	<b>1st and 2nd Order IIR Filter.</b>
	<p>
		The final step of our project was to replace our gain process with a full IIR filter (<a href="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</a>), with everything else already working, we need to either build a diagram of 
		blocks similar to that of <a href="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</a>, wiring it up as in <a href="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</a> (A quick mock-up of this can be seen in <a href="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</a>)  
		(; or we need to build our own single block that takes in the signal and filter coefficient, carries out all the processing internally, then outputs the filtered data (A mock-up of this can be found 
		in <a href="figs/fig8.html">Fig. 8</a>). It is probably easiest to start by building up a 1st order filter, then once that is complete we can just add a second layer with extra memory banks.
